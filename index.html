<p>Hello, world! This is my page</p>
<p>I've made this page to practice web development skills I've been learning
and to show off some of the things I've made with my 3D printer.</p>
<p> The type of printer I have used for all of these projects is an ANYCUBIC i3 Mega S.
    <br> For more details about this printer you can check it out
